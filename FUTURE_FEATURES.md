# Future Features & Enhancements

## 🎯 High Priority - Implement After Initial Launch

### Vendor Referral Program
**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** High
**When to implement:** After first 10-20 vendors are onboarded

**Why vendors need this:**
- Vendors have professional networks (photographers know DJs, planners, venues, etc.)
- Business-oriented users are more likely to refer others
- Motivated by cost savings and business growth
- Natural fit for professional networking

**Potential Rewards:**
- Monthly subscription credits (e.g., refer 3 vendors, get 1 month free)
- Commission reduction (e.g., reduce from 5% to 4% for 3 months)
- Tier upgrades (e.g., Premium user gets Featured perks for a month)
- Cash bonuses for paid tier referrals

**Features to Build:**
- Unique referral code/link for each vendor
- Referral dashboard showing:
  - Number of referrals sent
  - Number signed up
  - Current rewards/credits earned
  - Payout/credit history
- Share options: Email, social media, direct link
- Automated reward tracking and application
- Email notifications when referrals sign up

**Analytics to Track:**
- Referral conversion rate
- Most successful referrers
- Which tiers refer the most
- Average time from referral to signup

**Implementation Notes:**
- Wait until we have testimonials and happy vendors
- Survey first vendors about what rewards they'd prefer
- Consider tiered rewards (different for Free vs Elite vendors)
- Integrate with existing vendor dashboard
